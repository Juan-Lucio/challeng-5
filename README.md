## 4. Project Journey: From Theory to Implementation (Sprints 1-3)

This section details the evolution of the project across the three sprints, highlighting the theoretical concepts learned and applied at each stage.

### **Sprint 1: Laying the Foundation (CRUD & Database)**

* **Objective:** Create the basic web project, implement core CRUD functionality for orders, and establish database connectivity.
* **Theoretical Concepts Applied:**
    * **Spring Boot Fundamentals:** Understanding auto-configuration, starter dependencies (`web`, `data-jpa`), and the application lifecycle.
    * **REST Principles:** Designing resource-based endpoints (URIs), using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and standard status codes (200, 201, 404, 500).
    * **Dependency Injection (DI):** Using `@Autowired` to manage component dependencies (e.g., injecting Repository into Service, Service into Controller).
    * **Spring Data JPA:** Understanding Entities (`@Entity`), Repositories (`JpaRepository`), basic ORM concepts, and database interaction abstraction.
    * **Layered Architecture:** Structuring the code into distinct layers (Controller, Service, Repository, Entity) for maintainability and separation of concerns.
* **Implementation Highlights:**
    * Initialized the project using Spring Initializr.
    * Defined the `Order`, `Customer`, and `Product` entities.
    * Implemented `OrderRepository`, `OrderService`, and `OrderController` for CRUD operations.
    * Initially configured and connected to an H2 in-memory database, then migrated to a persistent PostgreSQL database using a detailed schema (`meli_database_schema_v2.sql`).
    * Created a Postman collection (`MELI_Order_API.postman_collection.json`) for manual API testing.
    * Established version control with Git and GitHub.
* **Key Outcomes:** A functional API capable of managing orders, connected to a persistent database, demonstrating core Spring Boot and REST concepts.

### **Sprint 2: Building for Reality (Environments & Security)**

* **Objective:** Introduce configuration management for different deployment environments and implement basic security considerations.
* **Theoretical Concepts Applied:**
    * **Spring Profiles:** Understanding how to create environment-specific configurations (`application-{profile}.yml`) and activate them (`spring.profiles.active`). This allows the same code to behave differently based on the environment.
    * **Externalized Configuration:** Moving environment-specific details (like database URLs) out of the main codebase and into configuration files.
    * **YAML Configuration:** Using the YAML format for more structured and readable configuration files compared to `.properties`.
    * **Environment Variables:** Learning how to inject sensitive information (like production passwords) using system environment variables (`${DB_PASSWORD}`) instead of hardcoding them, a crucial security practice.
    * **Database Connection Pooling (HikariCP):** Understanding the default connection pool provided by Spring Boot for efficient database connection management.
* **Implementation Highlights:**
    * Refactored configuration from a single `application.properties` to multiple YAML files: `application.yml` (common/default), `application-dev.yml` (H2), `application-test.yml` (H2 for tests), `application-prod.yml` (PostgreSQL using env var), and `application-dev-pg.yml` (PostgreSQL with password in file for convenience).
    * Defined distinct database connection details and JPA/Hibernate behaviors (`ddl-auto`) for each profile.
    * Implemented the use of the `DB_PASSWORD` environment variable for the production profile.
    * Updated the `README.md` with detailed instructions on how to activate profiles and set environment variables.
    * Created startup scripts (`start-dev.bat`/`.sh`, `start-prod.bat`/`.sh`) for easier execution.
    * Introduced VS Code Launch Configurations (`.vscode/launch.json`) for seamless profile switching directly from the IDE.
* **Key Outcomes:** An application ready for deployment in different environments, with secure handling of production credentials and improved developer experience through easy profile switching.

### **Sprint 3: Ensuring Quality & Professionalism (Docs & Testing)**

* **Objective:** Implement comprehensive API documentation and build a robust suite of automated tests.
* **Theoretical Concepts Applied:**
    * **OpenAPI Specification (Swagger):** Understanding the standard for describing REST APIs and using tools (`springdoc-openapi`) to automatically generate documentation from code.
    * **API Documentation Best Practices:** Using annotations (`@Operation`, `@ApiResponse`, etc.) to provide clear, detailed descriptions for endpoints, parameters, and responses.
    * **Unit Testing:** Principles of testing individual components in isolation. Using **JUnit 5** for the testing framework and **Mockito** for creating mock objects (e.g., mocking the `OrderRepository` when testing `OrderServiceImpl`) to isolate the unit under test. Concepts like Arrange-Act-Assert (Given-When-Then).
    * **Integration Testing:** Principles of testing the interaction between multiple components (Controller, Service, Repository, Database). Using **Spring Boot Test** (`@SpringBootTest`) to load the application context, **MockMvc** to simulate HTTP requests, and **`@ActiveProfiles("test")`** to ensure tests run against a dedicated test database (H2).
    * **Test Driven Development (TDD) concepts (applied loosely):** Writing tests to define expected behavior before or alongside implementation.
* **Implementation Highlights:**
    * Added the `springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui` dependency.
    * Created `OpenApiConfig.java` to customize Swagger UI metadata.
    * Heavily annotated `OrderController.java` with Swagger annotations for detailed documentation.
    * Developed `OrderServiceImplTest.java` with JUnit 5 and Mockito, covering various scenarios for the service layer methods.
    * Developed `OrderControllerIntegrationTest.java` using `@SpringBootTest` and `MockMvc` to test the full request lifecycle for key API endpoints against an H2 test database.
    * Ensured all tests pass using `.\mvnw.cmd test`.
* **Key Outcomes:** A professionally documented API accessible via `/swagger-ui.html` and a reliable application backed by automated unit and integration tests, ensuring future changes won't break existing functionality.

## 5. Demonstration: How the API Works

*(This section is where you would typically insert screenshots showing the application in action)*

### API Documentation (Swagger UI)

The primary way to explore the API is through the Swagger UI, available when the application is running.

**Access URL:** `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`

<img width="1364" height="860" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5038648b-5e7d-4e4b-8cfc-bc997ea94c13" />


This interface allows you to:
* See all available endpoints (`/api/v1/orders` and its sub-paths).
* Expand each endpoint to view details: HTTP method, description, parameters (path, query, body), and possible responses with schemas.
* **Try out** the API directly from the browser without needing Postman.

### Creating an Order (Postman/Swagger)

To create a new order, send a `POST` request to `/api/v1/orders` with a JSON body specifying the customer ID and order details.

**Example Request Body:**
json
{
    "customer": {
        "id": 1 // Use an existing customer ID from your database
    },
    "status": "PENDIENTE",
    "shippingAddress": "Av. Siempre Viva 742, Springfield",
    "total": 1299.50
}
<img width="1054" height="903" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ace13248-5a9b-4b53-99a3-ddb7485b84d3" />

Retrieving Orders (Postman/Swagger)
You can retrieve all orders or a specific order by ID.

Get All Orders: Send a GET request to /api/v1/orders.

Get Order by ID: Send a GET request to /api/v1/orders/{id} (replace {id} with the actual ID).
