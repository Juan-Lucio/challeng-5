# MELI - Order Management System API

## Overview

This project is a RESTful API for managing customer orders, developed as a solution to the technical challenges presented in the Digital NAO challenge. It is built using **Spring Boot 3**, **Java 17**, and connects to a **PostgreSQL** database.

The API provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for orders, following best practices for REST API design and project structure.

## Features

-   **CRUD Operations:** Full support for creating, reading, updating, and deleting orders.
-   **Relational Data Model:** Uses a PostgreSQL database with a structured schema to manage customers, products, and orders.
-   **RESTful Endpoints:** Clean and intuitive API endpoints under the `/api/v1/orders` path.
-   **Exception Handling:** Proper handling for cases where resources are not found (404 errors).

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
-   **Java 17** (or a later LTS version)
-   **Apache Maven** (v3.6 or later)
-   **PostgreSQL** (v12 or later)
-   **Git**

# üöÄ Sprint 1 ‚Äî Challenge Backlog  
**Project:** MELI Order Management System  
**Sprint Duration:** 2 Weeks  
**Objective:** Establish the backend foundation using Spring Boot 3.0 and Java 17, connect the PostgreSQL database, and implement CRUD functionality for managing orders efficiently.

## üß† User Stories (Sprint 1)

| # | User Story | Role | Description |
|---|-------------|------|--------------|
| **1** | As a *Developer*, I want to initialize the Spring Boot 3.0 project using Java 17 so that I can create a stable foundation for future modules. | Developer | The project must compile successfully, include dependencies, and contain a base controller template. |
| **2** | As a *DBA Engineer*, I want to configure the PostgreSQL connection so that the system can store and retrieve order data efficiently. | DBA Engineer | The app should connect to a PostgreSQL database with schema migration verified. |
| **3** | As a *Developer*, I want to design the `Order` entity and repository so that the data layer can persist and query order records. | Developer | Define entity relationships, data validation, and repository logic following Spring JPA conventions. |
| **4** | As a *Developer*, I want to implement the CRUD REST controller for orders so that the API can handle create, read, update, and delete requests. | Developer | Endpoints must be RESTful and tested through Postman. |
| **5** | As a *QA Engineer*, I want to test the endpoints with Postman so that I can confirm that all CRUD operations work as expected. | QA Engineer | All endpoints must return correct HTTP codes and payloads. |

---

## üßæ Table 1 ‚Äî Requirements List

| User Story | Requirements |
|-------------|---------------|
| **1. Initialize Spring Boot project** | Install Java 17; configure Maven dependencies; create `pom.xml`; define base package `com.meli.orders` and main class `MainApplication.java`. |
| **2. Configure PostgreSQL connection** | Define `application.yml` with DB credentials; create schema; configure `spring.datasource`; verify DB connectivity. |
| **3. Design Order entity and repository** | Create `Order` model (`id`, `customerName`, `totalAmount`, `status`); implement `OrderRepository` interface using JPA. |
| **4. Implement CRUD REST controller** | Create `OrderController`; implement methods: `POST /orders`, `GET /orders`, `PUT /orders/{id}`, `DELETE /orders/{id}`; use `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping`. |
| **5. Test CRUD endpoints with Postman** | Build Postman collection; validate HTTP responses (201, 200, 204, 404); ensure correct DB persistence. |
